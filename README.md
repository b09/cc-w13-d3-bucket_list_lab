# Full-stack Lab - Countries Bucket List

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to create a full-stack app
- Practice building a server with a MongoDB for persistence
- Understand the relationship between a client, server and database

## Brief

You need some new photos of you in exotic locations to get some more Instagram love. You've decided to create a bucket list app to keep track and manage all the places you want to visit. 

### MVP

- The bucket list is a list of country names
- The bucket list is persisted in a MongoDB on the server
- Access to the list is obtained via RESTful requests from the client
- User can select from a limited list of hard-coded countries to add a new item in their bucket list
- User should be able to see the current items on the list
- User should be able to delete an item

### Extensions

- Changed the hard-coded list of countries to be populated from the Countries API via a request on the client
- User should be able to save all of the data (name, population etc etc) for a particular country in their bucket list
- User should be able to see more detailed information in the UI about the countries in their bucket list
- Any other features you think would be cool in the app

## Considerations

- Test your code often. We value working software, even if it is not feature-complete. 
- Avoid writing too much code before verifying it works! Try and fix bugs one at a time.

## Planning

- You could -
  - make a list of your dependencies, and at what points you'll need them
  - draw some diagrams
  - look at previous solutions
  - decide on what parts of the app you'll tackle when

## Selected Inspiration
